# Spotify-Clone
This project is a simple Spotify web player clone built using HTML and CSS. It recreates the basic layout and design of the Spotify interface to practice frontend development skills.

The goal of this project was to improve my understanding of page layout, styling, positioning, flexbox, and responsive design. The UI includes a sidebar menu, playlist section, music cards, and a bottom music control bar similar to Spotify.

This is a static frontend project created for learning and practice purposes only.
